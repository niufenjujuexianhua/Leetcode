# 
# There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:
# 
#  
#  The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time. 
#  At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending a
# t any places, and will cover the original existing characters. 
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  
# Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count th
# e minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.
#  
# 
#  Example 1: 
#  
# Input: "aaabbb"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
#  
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
# Input: "aba"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the
#  string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.
#  
#  
# 
#  Hint: Length of the given string will not exceed 100. Related Topics Dynamic
