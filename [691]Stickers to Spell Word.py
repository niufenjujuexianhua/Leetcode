# 
# We are given N different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase Engli
# sh word on it.
#  
# You would like to spell out the given target string by cutting individual lett
# ers from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.
#  
# You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite qua
# ntities of each sticker.
#  
# What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the target? 
# If the task is impossible, return -1.
#  
# 
#  Example 1: 
#  Input: 
# ["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"
#  
# 
#  Output: 
# 3
#  
# 
#  Explanation: 
# We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
# After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the tar
# get "thehat".
# Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target stri
# ng.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  Input: 
# ["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"
#  
# 
#  Output: 
# -1
#  
# 
#  Explanation: 
# We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given stic
# kers.
#  
# 
#  Note:
#  stickers has length in the range [1, 50]. 
#  stickers consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes). 
#  target has length in the range [1, 15], and consists of lowercase English let
# ters. 
#  In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common U
# S English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random word
# s. 
#  The time limit may be more challenging than usual. It is expected that a 50 s
# ticker test case can be solved within 35ms on average.
