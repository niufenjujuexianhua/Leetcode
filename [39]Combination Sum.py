# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, re
# turn a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers su
# m to target. You may return the combinations in any order. 
# 
#  The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. T
# wo combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen number
# s is different. 
# 
#  It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target
#  is less than 150 combinations for the given input. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
# Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
# Explanation:
# 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple ti
# mes.
# 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
# These are the only two combinations.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
# Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  Example 4: 
# 
#  
# Input: candidates = [1], target = 1
# Output: [[1]]
#  
# 
#  Example 5: 
# 
#  
# Input: candidates = [1], target = 2
# Output: [[1,1]]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= candidates.length <= 30 
#  1 <= candidates[i] <= 200 
#  All elements of candidates are distinct. 
#  1 <= target <= 500
