# Given N axis-aligned rectangles where N > 0, determine if they all together fo
# rm an exact cover of a rectangular region. 
# 
#  Each rectangle is represented as a bottom-left point and a top-right point. F
# or example, a unit square is represented as [1,1,2,2]. (coordinate of bottom-lef
# t point is (1, 1) and top-right point is (2, 2)). 
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# rectangles = [
#   [1,1,3,3],
#   [3,1,4,2],
#   [3,2,4,4],
#   [1,3,2,4],
#   [2,3,3,4]
# ]
# 
# Return true. All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular re
# gion.
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# rectangles = [
#   [1,1,2,3],
#   [1,3,2,4],
#   [3,1,4,2],
#   [3,2,4,4]
# ]
# 
# Return false. Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# rectangles = [
#   [1,1,3,3],
#   [3,1,4,2],
#   [1,3,2,4],
#   [3,2,4,4]
# ]
# 
# Return false. Because there is a gap in the top center.
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 4: 
# 
#  
# rectangles = [
#   [1,1,3,3],
#   [3,1,4,2],
#   [1,3,2,4],
#   [2,2,4,4]
# ]
# 
# Return false. Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.
