# Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what matchst
# icks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one square by
#  using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but you can lin
# k them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time. 
# 
#  Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their s
# tick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you 
# could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl has. 
# 
#  Example 1: 
#  
# Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
# Output: true
# 
# Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came 
# two sticks with length 1.
#  
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
# Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
# Output: false
# 
# Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.
#  
#  
# 
#  Note: 
#  
#  The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of 0 to 10^9.
#  The length of the given matchstick array will not exceed 15.
