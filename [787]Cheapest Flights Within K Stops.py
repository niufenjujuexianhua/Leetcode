# There are n cities connected by m flights. Each flight starts from city u and 
# arrives at v with a price w. 
# 
#  Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city src and the
#  destination dst, your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with u
# p to k stops. If there is no such route, output -1. 
# 
#  
# Example 1:
# Input: 
# n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
# src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
# Output: 200
# Explanation: 
# The graph looks like this:
# 
# 
# The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as mar
# ked red in the picture. 
# 
#  
# Example 2:
# Input: 
# n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
# src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
# Output: 500
# Explanation: 
# The graph looks like this:
# 
# 
# The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as mar
# ked blue in the picture.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes n will be in range [1, 100], with nodes labeled from 0 to
#  n - 1. 
#  The size of flights will be in range [0, n * (n - 1) / 2]. 
#  The format of each flight will be (src, dst, price). 
#  The price of each flight will be in the range [1, 10000]. 
#  k is in the range of [0, n - 1]. 
#  There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.
