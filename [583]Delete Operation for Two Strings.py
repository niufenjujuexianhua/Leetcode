# 
# Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to 
# make word1 and word2 the same, where in each step you can delete one character i
# n either string.
#  
# 
#  Example 1: 
#  
# Input: "sea", "eat"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make 
# "eat" to "ea".
#  
#  
# 
#  Note: 
#  
#  The length of given words won't exceed 500. 
#  Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.
